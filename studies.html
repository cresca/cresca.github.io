				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>After three decades of becoming one of the best corporate restructuring and turnaround professionals in the industry,
				our client wanted to take his brand and business to the next level. He retained the Cresca Group to develop a marketing
				strategy that not only reached his existing clients to reinforce his brand and keep him top of mind, but also connect
				with the kinds of clients that would grow his existing practice.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>A ten-year old non-profit organization needed an overhaul of its strategic direction in order to discern what it - and
				its passionate constituents and membership - wanted to accomplish. With so many voices and so much enthusiasm, the organization
				was challenged to understand what it really wanted to do and how it was going to do it.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>Our client, a global online retailer, came to Cresca with a desire to build upon an already established brand portfolio with a
				goal of doubling revenues by 2020. With increasing competition in the marketplace, this multi-brand omni-channel online retailer
				enlisted Cresca to create an effective brand-led strategy to expand its reach in the US market and extend its reach across
				Europe and Asia.</p>

			<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
				<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				<p>By establishing him publicly as the go-to person in his field and creating a brand persona to match, Cresca worked closely with
				him to establish a blog, create social media profiles, secure speaking engagement opportunities and outline the development of a book.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
				<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				<p>The Cresca Group got involved in order to bring clarity where there was chaos. By meeting with leadership and membership, Cresca
				allowed the organization to re-imagine its mission and vision and properly articulate its core values. From there, a full process of
				strategic development ensued. The first step was understanding the strategic objectives of the organization, and only after were we
				able to focus on the strategic initiatives - the specific projects and efforts - that would best drive those objectives.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
				<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				<p>The Cresca Team conducted a comprehensive market assessment and developed a plan based on consumer needs, online shopping habits
				and brand perceptions. After extensive executive interviews and a thorough review of analytics data, Cresca recommended a realignment
				of the clientâ€™s brand portfolio that focused on fewer, stronger core brands. Using the information obtained during our market research
				phase we identified numerous growth opportunities, implemented the most successful ones and demonstrated their effect on future goals.</p>

				<h3>The Results</h3>
				<p>The combination of those elements and their adept execution within the larger marketing strategy transformed the opportunity and sales
				process of his work and professional services. After the publication of his book, Cresca established an online sales portal and payment
				solutions, as well as warehousing and fulfillment through its logistics partners to facilitate distribution.</p>

				<h3>The Results</h3>
				<p>With metrics in place to measure future success and a map to guide its ongoing work, this organization found its purpose again.
				Cresca continues to provide them with ongoing marketing and support.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
				<h3>The Results</h3>
				<p>With streamlined portfolio recommendations and a targeted market expansion strategy in place, the client's vision for the future is clear.
				The client has seen annual revenues increase and continues to rely on Cresca for the day-to-day management of numerous elements of its ecommerce
				operations.</p>
