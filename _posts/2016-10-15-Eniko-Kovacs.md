Enikő studies Japanese and German language and culture at her university, as well as tourist guidance in Budapest, Hungary. Her hobbies are travelling and learning new languages, which is the reason she is constantly seeking opportunities to discover the beauty of other cultures and improve her language skills. She also loves dedicating her free time to her family's pets. She has a dog, four cats, a rabbit, and a hedgehog.<br>
In the future, she wishes to become a teacher because in her opinion the greatest achievement in one's career is when one can motivate others and bring out the best in them.
