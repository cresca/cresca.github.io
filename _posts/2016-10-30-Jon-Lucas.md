Jon Lucas joined the customer service team with a strong background in the industry, bringing his training and expertise to our already dynamic team. He loves to understand how things work down to the most granular level, and applies that interest and passion to everything he touches, ensuring that customers are treated with the same courtesy and respect he wants bestowed upon himself. Don't let this analytical mind fool you, though - his creativity extends to writing stories of fictional worlds and histories. Jon also collects books, comics, art, pocket watches and tea sets.
