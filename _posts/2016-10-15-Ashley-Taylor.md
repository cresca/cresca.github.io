Ashley joined us shortly after completing her studies at SCAD. She is the graphically creative force of the Marketing Department, responsible for the production of all visual and design elements. Her keen sense of color, font and layout combine to create an emotional response in each interaction with her work. When visual harmony is felt across a website or set of marketing materials, she knows she has accomplished her mission. Ashley loves typography, cartoons and her dachshund.
