Karen believes that customer service is the backbone of any position, whether or not one connects directly with customers. All roles impact the overall customer experience. She finds it exhilarating to make connections with her colleagues and customers and turn their needs into satisfied realities. Karen supports local community theatre (Lionheart Theatre in Norcross is a favorite) and is the self-titled Best Aunt In The World.
