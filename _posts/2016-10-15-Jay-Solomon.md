Jay manages the business and operations of the Cresca Group, develops and maintains key client relationships and expands Cresca's horizons as it tackles challenges and leverages opportunities. He also takes an active role in overseeing the development of the LAMP Camp program. Always excited by where Cresca's adventures can take the team, he tries never to forget Warren Buffett's sage words that successful people say yes while truly successful people say no. Jay loves traveling, reading, mentoring and learning everything he can.
