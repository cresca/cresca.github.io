Jonathan's calm and collected nature and unwavering focus allow him to superbly see the process of order fulfillment through from start to finish. He greases the cogs of fulfillment, partnering with his customer service colleagues to ensure maximum customer satisfaction. There's nothing Jonathan hates more than a package shipped out more than 24 hours after an order is placed. Jonathan also loves animation, illustration and playing guitar. Everyone he meets considers him to be a pretty stand-up guy.
