Nandor finds satisfaction in the precision required to earn a Finance MSc degree from Corvinus University of Budapest. Passionate about serving in an international environment, after graduation he will pursue a career as a consultant with a multinational company.<br>
His favorite way to relax is with a good TV series or movie. The series Suits is a favorite, as well as DC and Marvel universe movies (although everyone knows Marvel is best!).
