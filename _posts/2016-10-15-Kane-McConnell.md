Kaneâ€™s career in IT really started as a 9-year-old boy in Myrtle Beach, SC where his dad was a manager at the local Radio Shack. One weekend he brought home a ZX81, popped in a tape cassette and showed Kane how to access the command prompt. The rest, as they say, is history. Today, Kane not only leads the technology and development efforts at Cresca, he also serves as the director of LAMP Camp where he mentors a diverse group of aspiring developers who help in the creation of client applications. Kane is the proud owner of a Catalina 22 sailing yacht and in his spare time can often be found navigating the peaceful waters of Lake Lanier.
