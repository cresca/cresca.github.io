Patrick is responsible for the creation, implementation, development and maintenance of product listings across all of Cresca's clients' online sales channels, from marketplaces like Amazon, eBay and Rakuten, to proprietary websites on systems like Magento and Bigcommerce. He thrives on enormous undertakings that can be whittled down bit by bit. There is no project too large to scare him off. Patrick likes reading, video games and other "indoor kid" activities.
