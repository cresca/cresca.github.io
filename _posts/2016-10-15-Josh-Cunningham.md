Josh powers Cresca's fulfillment partner, and as the key strategic liaison between the two teams, he ensures that the logistics, warehousing and fulfillment information that Cresca needs to help its clients is readily available. His breakneck pace, constantly positive attitude and get-it-done-now approach are perfect for ensuring that the rhythm and cadence of domestic and international fulfillment continue to flow smoothly, rapidly and reliably. As an expert at Amazon Prime preparation, Josh oversees the efficient production and shipment of all of our clients' FBA freight. He really appreciates a well-architected inventory management solution, but his true passions are sports, music and going on trips that involve sleeping outdoors.
