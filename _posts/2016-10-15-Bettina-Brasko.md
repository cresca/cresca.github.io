Bettina is a Hungarian entrepreneur passionate about art, books and languages. She runs her own small business through which she works mainly as an illustrator, but she has grand ambitions about writing and translation as well. Behind everything is her goal to bring a smile to people's faces, no matter what service she is providing. She believes remote working is the best thing since sliced bread, as it allows her to connect with a colorful bunch of people from all around the globe.
