András brings years of consulting experience – which is to say, he has a customer-focused mindset – and a no-nonsense work ethic to the Cresca Team. He is a student of English and Eastern-Asian cultures and plans to travel throughout Asia as soon as he's able. His interests include reading about the exploits of great entrepreneurs, listening to Neil deGrasse Tyson lectures and using one of the many street work-out locations in Budapest.
