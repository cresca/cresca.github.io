Dominik is a Fulfillment Specialist in our European division, who is studying vehicle engineering. His greatest dream is to reform the Hungarian car modification sphere. He loves to draw and is a tattoo addict, who just started to make efforts to become a tattoo artist. He also loves learning languages so that he can better understand other cultures through their spoken word.
