		<p>At Cresca, we recognize the importance of creating an environment in which all our employees feel valued,
		included and empowered. We recognize that each employeeâ€™s unique experiences, perspectives, and viewpoints
		are critical not only to creating services and products that engage and inspire our clients and customers all
		over the world but also in making their work and lives fulfilling and worthwhile. Our goal is to create an
		environment that is an incubator for great ideas and attractive to the best talent by creating a profound sense
		of pride in the work that we do and who we are.</p>

        <p>Therefore, Cresca maintains an ongoing commitment to welcoming, valuing, and centering diverse perspectives from
        people at every level of our organization. This commitment to inclusion encompasses diversity based on ethnicity,
        race, nationality, immigration status, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, spirituality, abilities, education,
        economic class, social class, body shape and size, and others. We also appreciate that people's perspectives do not
        exist solely along any one of these dimensions but from the intersection of these elements that form a person's unique
        identity and valuable perspective.</p>

        <p>Our diversity and inclusion efforts will focus on:<br>
            - Leading and managing inclusively<br>
            - Creating a work environment that fosters growth and advancement by centering the contributions of the individual for the benefit of the team<br>
            - Engaging with each other and our customers in a way that reflects and respects their unique perspectives and experiences
        </p>

        <p>Our diversity and inclusion objectives, and progress towards achieving them, will be assessed annually to ensure they
        align with our business and talent objectives and our sense of what it is to, simply put, do the right thing.</p>
