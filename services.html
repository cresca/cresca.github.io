				<h2 id="content">Branding and Marketing</h2>
				<p>At Cresca we’re a business that helps other businesses grow because it's in our collective success that we find our joy.
				Our marketing team offers a balanced mix of technical know how and practical experience. We treat each of our clients’
				businesses as if they were our own and have a proven track record growing businesses and their reach through creative,
				consistent and data-driven action.</p>
				<p>We start by working with you to develop a marketing strategy. Helping define your company and
				brand from the top down and envisioning where you want your business to be in three to five years allows us to craft a strategic
				map to help you get there. Think of us as your market cartographers. However, rather than use some cookie cutter formula, we truly
				learn about your business and what makes it unique. By developing recommendations on promotional material, identifying advertising
				opportunities, fine tuning your corporate image, developing an internet strategy and finding the mystical voice of your brand,
				we will help you launch and build campaigns, social media persona and more.</p>
				<p>The ultimate goal is taking your business to the next level and actualizing the vision of where you want to be.</p>

				<h2 id="content">Business Development</h2>

				to bookkeeping and IT infrastructure. Whatever is consuming your day to day, let us take it off your plate so that you can focus on the core widget that you know so well. As we

			<div class="6u 12u$(medium) service-desc customer hidden-elem">
				<h2 id="content">Customer Support</h2>
				<p>If at its core, business is exchanging goods or services for money, then the essence of business rests on a platform of relationships.
				Interacting with your customers is the most important thing you'll do all day. It is your customers, after all, who are the other half
				of everything you do. They complete you.</p>
				<p>You want to trust that the bond holding together that customer relationship is always strong.
				And that's where the Cresca Group comes in. Our experienced team of customer service specialists are adept at providing a full-service experience
				for your clients, supporting nearly any product, widget or service. We're so effective because we consider the entire customer experience.</p>
				<p>We are not just handling your phone calls, emails and chat through our advanced ticketing system. We are considering start to finish how
				your customers prefer to interact with you and every touch point a customer has to ensure that each interaction is consistent, representative
				of your brand and effective at securing the results you want.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="6u 12u$(medium) service-desc financial hidden-elem">
				<h2 id="content">Financial and Accounting Services</h2>
				<p>If you don't know where you are at every moment financially, you are lost. Let us make sure that your financials are always up to date, accurate
				and accessible. Our services are more than just P&amp;Ls and Balance Sheets, though. With our help, you can unlock the possibilities buried in your
				financial data. Whether its sales or expenses, COGS or assets, we're here to help you sort through the details and visualize the information that's
				important to your business.</p>
				<p>Many of our clients are accustomed to Quickbooks or other simple online solutions, and while these have their place, they
				may not be telling you everything you need to know to make the most impactful decisions right now. Knowing what your expenses are is one thing. Knowing
				how to reduce them without impacting your ability to function successfully is another. Are you managing your cash-flow effectively? Are your inventory
				fluctuations costing you sales?</p>
				<p>These and many others are the questions we can help you answer. Time spent simply on book keeping is time lost on valuable
				financial analysis. Let us remove and simplify that burden and present you with the information that will move the needle on your business's KPIs. Wait,
				you haven't established your KPIs? We definitely need to talk.</p>

			<div class="6u 12u$(medium) service-desc logistics hidden-elem">
				<h2 id="content">Logistics and Fulfillment</h2>
				<p>“Having the right item in the right quantity at the right time at the right place for the right price in the right condition to the right customer” is
				how Mallik sums up logistics. But if it were that simple, everyone could do it. In truth, managing logistics is one of the most challenging aspects of any
				businesses.</p>
				<p>Whether you’re an established entity or just starting out, as a retailer you need to know exactly where your goods are at any given time, what
				the status of your outstanding shipments are, and how much and when to order next. Our experience and global connections make it easier to navigate the
				intricacies of logistics, as we work with our global partners to bring you access to affordable warehousing and fulfillment all around the world. You can
				grow your business as large as you want without investing in additional warehouses, personnel or infrastructure because Cresca makes it easier for you to scale
				your business. Warehouse management, transportation management, delivery management, asset management, and border procedure management are just a few of the areas
				where we provide exceptional value to our clients.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="6u 12u$(medium) service-desc payment hidden-elem">
				<h2 id="content">Payment Processing</h2>
				<p>Selling in a new country can be challenging. Consolidating payments across multiple channels can be a headache. Payment processing often involves excessive paperwork,
				compliance complexities, merchant processors, transacting banks and other parties - and everyone wants a cut of your margin for their "trouble." We can alleviate much of
				the burden associated with online payment processing for small and medium retailers.</p>
				<p>Through one of our strategic partnerships, we're able to offer our customers the benefits
				of our excellently leveraged payment forwarding and consolidation services. The advantages of this service are particularly outstanding for international customers, who go
				through more challenges to get bank and PayPal accounts that can accept United States Dollars. By utilizing these payment forwarding services, our clients can tap the entire
				US market without having to sacrifice margin for outrageous international or conversion fees. And Cresca's role here is not to take a cut from your margins - heaven forbid!
				We will assess your current state of payment processing and learn what you're trying to accomplish.</p>
				<p>If our partner can be the most strategic advocate to accomplish your pursuits,
				then we'll team you up - if not, we'll help guide you in the right direction to simplify your arrangement and maximize your profits.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="6u 12u$(medium) service-desc product hidden-elem">
				<h2 id="content">Product Sourcing</h2>
				<p>Have the perfect place to sell an existing product, but just need them in bulk in a week? Want your company's logo on, well, anything? Whatever the need or idea, let us acquire
				it for you.</p>
				<p>Our strategic partners in the United States and around the globe develop, manufacturer and source almost anything you could want. If it's not readily available,
				we can help you get it manufactured. Don't be shy about the idea or the need. If you're wondering whether or not it's viable, we'll help you walk through the process of the
				design, the plan, the execution and all the steps between right now and your successful tomorrow.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="6u 12u$(medium) service-desc technology hidden-elem">
				<h2 id="content">Technology Solutions</h2>
				<p>When you think of IT Solutions what picture comes to mind? A bunch of guys wearing high-water pants and pocket protectors a la
				“Revenge of the Nerds”? Or maybe it’s the cast of “Silicon Valley” huddled around a bunch of computers in a makeshift living
				room workspace? It's time to dispense with those antiquated notions of "your local IT guy" and meet the modern face of Information
				Technology.</p>
				<p>Cresca’s in-house development team is augmented by the talent assembled at LAMP Camp™ —a cutting edge developer mentorship
				program that turns coders into developers through real-world experience building enterprise applications using PHP, MySQL, Linux,
				SharePoint and more. Our meeting rooms are equipped with Dueling Whiteboards – whiteboards facing each other on either side of the
				room to allow for multiple people to map out their free-flowing ideas – which creates the perfect environment for discussion,
				collaborations and charting a development path. Rather than simply assemble a collection of off the shelf software packages and
				call it a solution, we take the time to figure out what challenges your business faces and develop systems to help automate the
				processes that slow you down.</p>
				<p>We want to understand the issues at hand and work with you to brainstorm the possible scenarios your
				end-user encounters. Whether it's a website or custom enterprise software, this approach allows us to deliver a world class solution
				that makes sense for you, your industry and your business.</p>
