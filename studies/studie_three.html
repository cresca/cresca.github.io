    				goal of doubling revenues by 2020. With increasing competition in the marketplace, this multi-brand omni-channel online retailer

    				<p>The Cresca Team conducted a comprehensive market assessment and developed a plan based on consumer needs, online shopping habits
    				and brand perceptions. After extensive executive interviews and a thorough review of analytics data, Cresca recommended a realignment
    				of the clientâ€™s brand portfolio that focused on fewer, stronger core brands. Using the information obtained during our market research
    				phase we identified numerous growth opportunities, implemented the most successful ones and demonstrated their effect on future goals.</p>
