    				<p>After three decades of becoming one of the best corporate restructuring and turnaround professionals in the industry,
    				our client wanted to take his brand and business to the next level. He retained the Cresca Group to develop a marketing
    				strategy that not only reached his existing clients to reinforce his brand and keep him top of mind, but also connect
    				with the kinds of clients that would grow his existing practice.</p>

    				<p>By establishing him publicly as the go-to person in his field and creating a brand persona to match, Cresca worked closely with
    				him to establish a blog, create social media profiles, secure speaking engagement opportunities and outline the development of a book.</p>
